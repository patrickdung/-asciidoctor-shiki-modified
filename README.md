# Asciidoctor Syntax Highlight Extension for Node.js

POC.

- The original code from [TANIGUCHI Masaya]
would hang when using on specific node.js application like Astro (deasync problem)

- David Jencks's extension works on Antora but it is not directly usable for Asciidoctor.
  But he pointed out that the converted code block would have nested ```<pre>/<code>``` section.
  He also have logic to remove the nested code block.

- Anthony Fu's markdown-it module show how to use the Synckit worker.

## Problems

1. Double ```<pre><code>``` blocks, this could be AsciiDoctor problem

First code block

```
<pre class="undefined highlight" id="codecell0">
  <code data-lang="yaml">
```

Then it would have another <pre><code> (shiki).
The codes from David Jencks would remove the nested block.

2. This is POC. No code linting and not pushed to npmjs.

## Usage

This extension is not designed for browser.
You must not use this extension without Node.js.
